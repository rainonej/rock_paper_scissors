RockPaperScissors
=================

fork test
CAMERON: To run the game, go to Run_game.py in the Version_2 folder. Feel free to use the Run_game function with either UI or UI2.

Pitch:
The true purpose of writing this program is to practice coding. But this isn't just a simple script to play rock paper scissors. In Version 2, I made User Interfaces into a class with a Default UI. The UI is extreamly modable, so with a few lines of code you can change the skin of the game entirely.

Version 1 ToDoList

[+] Write my own version of the original code

[+] Make separate classes for Players, Games, and AI

[+] Construct a simple user Interface to allow to play the game multiple times

[+] Create save files for different player accounts

[+] Have the program remember who the last player was and assume that they're back again (to save time in selection screen)

Version 2 ToDoList

[+] Stream line some parts of the code 

[+] Give an options menu to: edit the players list, show high scores, etc...

[ ] Make a 'Leader Board' where the high scores of all players are ranked

[+] Turn the UIs into instances of a class, and make them extremely 'modular'

[ ] Write a simple proof of concept UI that reskins the original RockPaperScissors game to a fantasy setting

[ ] Make a UI that is a little more streamlined (bring back the assumptions 'recent player' option) and clears the screen between each round for readability


AI ToDoList

[+] Create a standard random AI 

[+] Gain massive amounts of data about humans playing rock paper scissors online (thanks to Lasse Hassing from RoShamBo.com)

[+] Process the data on a super computer (done using Stampede2) (spoiler alert: humans are bad at picking random values)

[ ] Create a simple AI that picks its move based on these statistics

[ ] Create an AI which does the same thing as before, but with learned behavior from its human oponent

[ ] Create a fitness function to test different AI's against human data (same data as before, but obviously a part of the data that wasn't used already)

Future Goals

[ ] Create a Graphical User Interface

[ ] Be able to host this online (support 2 non-local player)

[ ]


The new goal of this project is to:

[+] Fix the old code so that it works, isn't as heavy, and looks nicer

[+] Create save files for individual players

[+] Create a User Interface


[+] Gain massive amounts of data online and use a super computer (Stampede2) to process it

[ ] Interpret and use the processed data

[ ] Find a nice way to work with the elements of the rock, paper, scissors game. Maybe make the elements a subclass or a seperate class. Or make a successor function.

[ ] Create an AI which can predict human behavior of rock, paper, scissors

[ ] Create a way to test the AI. Perhaps a fitness function.

[ ] Create a Graphical User Interface for the game

[ ] Get sound for the game

[ ] Turn this into a 'strategy' and turn based RPG. The player and the enemys have health bars.
Have everything about the game designed to lull the player into a pattern: upgrades to make certain moves stronger or provide more defence, upgrades to make certain combinations even stronger (using rock twice in a row dose double damage the second time), have a count down timer to that there isn't too much time to think each round (this will also make people want to play more rounds), have 8-bit music which provides a different note/sound for each element you choose (also a sound effect for winning or loosing). 

[ ] The final boss will have learned from the players previous moves and develups a strategy that has a higher than 50% chance of winning.
